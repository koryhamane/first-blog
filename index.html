            <p>     Hi! My name is Kory and, as you may already know, this is the "first" blog post of my programming journey.
                "First" is in parentheses because I've already taken a course on Python, so it's not really my first day
                learning how to code. However, I would consider this my first day being able to put words and pictures on a webpage to
                then be viewed on a browser.</p>
            <p>It's nothing fancy, but it's something! For this webpage, I've used the same html and css format from chapter 1 of this
                book:
            <figure class="Textbook">
                <img class="TextbookImg" src="img/Ben Frain HTML CSS.jpg" alt="ben frain image" />
                <figcaption class="Figcaption"></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="one"><center></center></p>
            <p>I have a ton of work to do, but I think this is a pretty good start! I probaly won't be posting everyday, but hopefully a few times per week... I guess we'll see!</p>
