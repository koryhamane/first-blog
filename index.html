            <p>     Hi! My name is Kory and, as you may already know, this is the "first" blog post of my programming journey.
                "First" is in parentheses because I've already taken a course on Python, so it's not really my first day
                learning how to code. However, I would consider this my first day being able to put words and pictures on a webpage to
                then be viewed on a browser.</p>
            <p>It's nothing fancy, but it's something! For this webpage, I've used the same html and css format from chapter 1 of this
                book:
            <figure class="Textbook">
                <img class="TextbookImg" src="img/Ben Frain HTML CSS.jpg" alt="ben frain image" />
                <figcaption class="Figcaption"></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I have a ton of work to do, but I think this is a pretty good start! I probaly won't be posting everyday, but hopefully a few times per week... I guess we'll see!</p>

            <p>     Yup, you guessed it! I learned how to add a video onto the blog. I'm not sure how much this gives a better picture
                of my life, but I imported a TikTok video from our family TikTok page. This page features my wife, my older son (9), and younger son (2), and myself. We've probably posted 100-150 videos, but this is one
                of our most recent ones:

            <p> There are also a bunch of websites that can seamlessly and effortlessly embed any video that you choose, regardless of
                where it came from. Other things I've learned are how to properly format, nest, and integrate media queries. Lastly, the color
                scheme changes when a viewer is using the "dark mode" setting on their computer or mobile device.

            <p>     Today I learned to add a header and footer and, therefore, that is why you can see
                some words that will hopefully turn into button at the top of the page and some sections
                that will hopefully be other miscellaneous things you'll usually see at the bottom of a webpage (
                    more links, comment section, etc.). Also I played around with Flexbox, which is why the footer
                    appears to be in blocks. For now, the words in the header and footer are just placeholders. Hopefully,
                    we can turn them into something cool.
            </p>
            <p>Also, in case you're wondering, I definiltely plan on changing this color scheme. I'm not exactly sure
                what I 'm going for, but it's not this. Anyway...
